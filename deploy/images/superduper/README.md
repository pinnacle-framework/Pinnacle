This image wraps the pinnacle.io framework into a [Jupyter Notebook.](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/blob/main/images/singleuser-sample/Dockerfile) 

Additionally, the image is shipped with a variety of examples from the pinnacle.io [use-cases.](https://github.com/pinnacle.io/pinnacle/tree/main//docs/content/use_cases/items)


To build the image:

```


To run the image:

```shell
docker run -p 8888:8888 pinnacle/pinnacle:latest
``` 



## Building

For the sandbox we need to build the latest code against the latest dependencies.
This can be tricky as it requires for Dockerfile to access files outside of this directory.

Instead of moving the Dockerfile to the root directory, we use a trick with `Makefile`

.dockerconfig to ignore boring packets from sandbox

# SuperDuperDB documentation

ðŸš€ Welcome to SuperDuperDB! ðŸš€

## What is SuperDuperDB?

SuperDuperDB is a Python package providing tools for developers to apply AI and machine learning in their already deployed MongoDB database, and simulatenously to set-up a scalable, open-source and auditable environment to do this.

## Mission

At SuperDuperDB, our goal is to massively facilitate and accelerate the developer journey between data and AI models. We aim to:

- Create an **easy-to-use**, **extensible** and **comprehensive** Python framework for integrating AI and
  ML directly to the datalayer: to databases, object-storage, data-lakes and data-warehouses.
- Empower developers, data scientists and architects to leverage the vast AI
  **open-source ecosystem** in their datalayer deployments.
- Enable ways-of-working with AI and data which **enable scalability** and industrial scale deployment,
  as well as providing easy-to-use tools for the **individual developer**.
- Make possible continued use of **already existing or deployed databases**, in combination with AI and ML;
  **no migration of data** to a fancy, new fangled vector-database required.
- Follow a **fully open-source approach**, in particular prioritizing open-source integrations
  in our roadmap going forward
- Enable individuals and organizations to **circumvent vendor lock-in strategies** now ubiquitous
  in the AI and ML landscapes, by providing a clear toolset to flexibly deploy AI at the
  datalayer **without necessitating subscriptions**, cloud installations, or gated-model-API functionality.

## What can you do with SuperDuperDB?

- **Deploy** all your AI models to automatically **populate model outputs** back into MongoDB in a single environment with simple Python commands.  
- **Train** models on your data on top of MongoDB simply by querying without additional ingestion and pre-processing.  
- **Integrate** AI APIs (such as OpenAI) to work together with other models on your data effortlessly. 
- **Search** your data in MongoDB with vector-search, including model management and serving.

### Who is SuperDuperDB for?

  - **Python developers** using MongoDB who want to use AI in their applications with ease.
  - **Data scientists & ML engineers** who want to develop AI models using their favourite tools, with minimum infrastructural overhead.
  - **Infrastructure engineers** who want a single scalable setup that supports both local, on-prem and cloud deployment.

### SuperDuperDB transforms your MongoDB into

  - **An end-to-end live AI deployment** which includes a **model repository and registry**, **model training** and **computation of outputs/ inference** 
  - **A feature store** in which the model outputs are stored alongside the inputs in any data format. 
  - **A fully functional vector database** to easily generate vector embeddings of your data with your favorite models and APIs and connect them with MongoDB or LanceDB vector search 
  - *(Coming soon)* **A model performance monitor** enabling model quality and degradation to be monitored as new data is inserted  

## Background

SuperDuperDB is the result of years of experience in research, development and production for
AI and data. We have come to believe that AI development with data does not need to be as hard as it
currently is. (Read "{doc}`common_issues`"
for more context.) By moving to a closer symbiosis of AI and the datalayer/ database, we believe
many pain-points in AI development become non-issues. With SuperDuperDB:

- Model predictions may be [evaluated and inserted back into the database](#model-frameworks-directly-integrated-with-databases), without ever needing
  to load data from the database to the client-side.
- Training may be [deployed in one line](#model-frameworks-directly-integrated-with-databases), without having to munge, preprocess or fetch data;
  simply point to the data with a data-base query.
- Models may be configured to [watch for incoming data](#continuous-model-processing-on-incoming-data), maintaining a catalogue of up-to-date
  predictions and features.
- Working [with difficult data types](#support-for-tricky-datatypes), (images, audio, etc.) requires no additional effort in comparison
  to working with "standard data" (numbers, text, etc.)
- Outputs of configured AI models may be used to "navigate" the database, including [configuring
  and using vector-search](#use-your-classical-database-as-a-vector-database) with just a few lines of Python code.

## High-Level Features

In the initial [v0.1 release]() we have built the following features on top of MongoDB, with a view to greatly expanding our breadth to a range of datalayer implementations, especially implementations which use SQL-dialects as the query-language. You can follow the high-level roadmap [here]().

### Model frameworks directly integrated with the datalayer

SuperDuperDB includes wrappers for treating models from diverse AI frameworks across the open-source Python ecosystem uniformly in combination with the datalayer, using a scikit-learn-like
`.fit` and `.predict` API.

```python
# [ Code snippets assume access to a running MongoDB instance read/write ]
from sklearn.svm import SVC
import pymongo

from pinnacledb.db.mongodb import Collection
from pinnacledb import pinnacle

# Models and database clients can be converted to SuperDuperDB objects with a simple wrapper.
model = pinnacle(SVC())

# SuperDuperDB uses MongoDB by default. SQL integrations are on the way.
db = pinnacle(pymongo.MongoClient().my_db)

# Once wrapped, we can fit and predict "in" the database, simply
# specifying the data to be processed with a query.
coll = Collection(name='my_collection')
model.fit(X='input_col', y='predict_col', db=db, select=coll.find({'_fold': 'train'}))

# Predictions are saved in the database alongside the inputs.
model.predict(X='input_col', db=db, select=coll.find({'_fold': 'valid'}))
```

### Continuous model processing on incoming data
SuperDuperDB contains components allowing developers to configure models to continuously infer outputs on specified data, and save the outputs back to the database.

```python
# Watch the database for incoming data, and process this with a model
# Model outputs are continuously stored in the input records
model.predict(X='input_col', db=db, select=coll.find(), watch=True)
```

## Use models outputs as inputs to downstream models

Simply add a simple method `featurize` to your queries, to register the fact that one model depends on another:

```python
model.predict(
		X='input_col',
		db=db,
		select=coll.find().featurize({'X': '<upstream-model-id>'}),  # already registered upstream model-id
		watch=True,
)
```

### Support for "tricky" datatypes

SuperDuperDB includes tools for working with the database using the complex data types necessary for AI, such as vectors, tensors, images, audio etc. Native python types may be flexibly saved to the DB, to ease use in tricky AI use-cases, such as computer vision:

```python
from pinnacledb.ext.pillow import pil_image as i

# Encoders are first class SuperDuperDB objects which deal with serializing
# "non-standard" data to the database
db.execute(
  coll.insert_many([
    {'img': i(PIL.image.open(path))} for path in images
  ])
)
```

Data may be reloaded using standard database queries, and conveniently reused in downstream applications, or consumed as direct inputs to AI models. The data loaded are instances of the same Python classes as inserted.

```python
>>> r = db.execute(coll.find_one())
>>> r['img'].x
<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGBA size=1164x860>
```

### Use your classical database as a vector database

SuperDuperDB contains functionality allowing users to treat their standard database as a vector-search database, integrating your primary database with key-players in the open-source vector-search space.
```python
# First a "Watcher" makes sure vectors stay up-to-date
indexing_watcher = Watcher(model=OpenAIEmbedding(), key='text', select=collection.find())

# This "Watcher" is linked with a "VectorIndex"
db.add(VectorIndex('my-index', indexing_watcher=indexing_watcher))

# The "VectorIndex" may be used to search data. Items to be searched against are passed
# to the registered model and vectorized. No additional app layer is required.
# By default, SuperDuperDB uses LanceDB for vector comparison operations
db.execute(collection.like({'text': 'clothing item'}, 'my-index').find({'brand': 'Nike'}))
```

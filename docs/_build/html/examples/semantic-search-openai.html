<p>In this example, we look at how to use SuperDuperDB for semantic vector search, in particular, leveraging a model which is hosted by OpenAI. In later examples, we look at how to apply vector search using other API providers, using model libraries, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">transformers</span></code>, and also home baked models.</p>

<p>In order to configured the model to vectorize the documents, we specify a <strong>watcher</strong>. This is a pair of model, and important settings defining what exactly is converted to vectors. Here we specify that the content of the “abstract” field should be vectorized. In other examples, one could combine all fields, or choose a subset:</p>

<p>So that’s it! In general implementing vector search, means simply passing a model which returns vectors, and configuring SuperDuperDB to “watch” the collection/ database with that collection.</p>
<p>In general, SuperDuperDB can be used for much more than vector search. The models which are added to collections, may output a flexible assortment of outputs - classification, language modeling and beyond are all easy to implement.</p>

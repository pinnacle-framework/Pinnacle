# Installation

## Prerequisites

We assume you are running:

- Python3.8+
- MongoDB

The deployments can be existing deployments already running in your infrastructure, or
bespoke deployments which you'll use specifically for SuperDuperDB.

For MongoDB here are instructions for 2 very popular systems:

- [MongoDB installation on Ubuntu](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu)
- [MongoDB installation on MacOSX](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)

## Installation using `pip`

`pip install pinnacledb`

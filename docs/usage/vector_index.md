# Vector Indexes 

```{note}
SuperDuperDB provides first-class support for Vector-Search, including 
encoding of inputs by arbitrary AI models.
```

SuperDuperDB has support for vector-search via LanceDB using vector-indexes.
We are working on support for vector-search via MongoDB enterprise search in parallel.

Vector-indexes build on top of the [DB](db), [models](models) and [listeners](listeners).

## Creating vector indexes

In order to build a vector index, one defines one or two models, and daemonizes them with listeners.
In the simples variant one does simply:

```python
from pinnacledb.container.vector_index import VectorIndex
from sueprduperdb.core.listener import listener

db.add(
    VectorIndex(indexing_listener='my-model/my-key')
)
```

The model `my-model` should have already been registered with SuperDuperDB (see [models](models) for help). `my-key` is the field to be searched. Together `my-model/my-key` refer to the [listener](listeners) component (previously created) which is responsible for computing vectors from the data.
See [here](listener) for how to create such a component.

Alternatively the model and listener may be created inline. 
Here is how to define a simple libear bag-of-words model:

```python
from pinnacledb.container.vector_index import VectorIndex
from pinnacledb.container.listener import Listener
from pinnacledb.model.sentence_transformers.wrapper import Pipeline


class TextEmbedding:
    def __init__(self, lookup):
        self.lookup = lookup  # mapping from strings to pytorch tensors

    def __call__(self, x):
        return sum([self.lookup[y] for y in x.split()])


db.add(
    VectorIndex(
        identifier='my-index',
        indexing_listener=Listener(
            model=TorchModel(
                preprocess=TextEmbedding(d),  # "d" should be loaded from disk
                object=torch.nn.Linear(64, 512),
            )
key = '<key-to-search>',
)
)
)
```

## Using vector indexes with MongoDB

To use your vector index to search MongoDB, there are two possibilities:

Firstly, find similar matches and then filter the results:

```python
>> > from pinnacledb.container.document import Document as D
>> > db.execute(
    ...
Collection('my-coll')
....like(D({'<key-to-search>': '<content' >}), vector_index='my-index')
....find( < filter >, < projection >)
... )
```

Secondly, filter the data and find similar matches within the results:

```python
>>> db.execute(
...    Collection('my-coll')
...        .like(D({'<key-to-search>': '<content'>}), vector_index='my-index')
...        .find(<filter>, <projection>)
... )
```

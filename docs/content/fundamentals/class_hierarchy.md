# Class hierarchy of user-facing classes

![](/img/class-hierarchy.png)

## `pinnacle`

`pinnacle` is the entry point to connect and 
be able to use key functionality. It returns a built `Datalayer`.

## `Datalayer`

The `Datalayer` class, an instance of which we refer to throughout this 
documentation as `db`, is the key entrypoint via which developers
may connect to their data-infrastructure and additional connect
AI functionality to their data-infrastructure:

The `Datalayer` connects to data, with the [`pinnacle` function](../core_api/connect).

***`.apply`***

AI `Component` instances may be applied to the built `Datalayer` [with `.apply`](../core_api/apply).

***`.execute`***

The data and AI outputs are accessible with queries and AI models 
using the `.execute` method. This can include standard database queries,
vector-search queries (which include model inference) and pure model computations.
See [here](../core_api/execute).

## `Component`

AI functionality is packaged as a `Component`. Key implementations 
are `Model`, `Listener` and `VectorIndex`.

## `Document`

`Document` is a wrapper around standard Python `dict` instances, 
but which can encode their contained fields as a mixture of JSON
and pure `bytes`. This mechanism can in principle handle any information 
which Python can handle.

Since most databases can handle this type of information, this makes
`Document` a crucial piece in connecting AI (which operates over a range of information)
and the database.

## `_BaseEncodable`

This is the base class, which allows `pinnacledb` to decide how to save "special" data.

## `Serializable`

An extension of Python `dataclasses`, but easier to get the original class back 
from the serialized dictionary form. This is the base class underlying 
all `pinnacledb` queries and predictions as well as mixing into `Component`.

## `Job`

`Component` instances applied with `Datalayer.apply` create compute-jobs 
in response to incoming data, and on initialization via the `Job` class.

The interface on `Component` is `Component.schedule_jobs`.

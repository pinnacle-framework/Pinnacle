# Mission

At SuperDuperDB, our goal is to massively facilitate and accelerate the developer journey between data and AI models. We aim to:

- Create an **easy-to-use**, **extensible** and **comprehensive** Python framework for integrating AI and
  ML directly to the datastore: to databases, object-storage, data-lakes and data-warehouses.
- Empower developers, data scientists and architects to leverage the vast AI
  **open-source ecosystem** in their datastore deployments.
- Enable ways-of-working with AI and data which **enable scalability** and industrial scale deployment,
  as well as providing easy-to-use tools for the **individual developer**.
- Make possible continued use of **already existing or deployed datastores**, in combination with AI and ML;
  **no migration of data** to a fancy, new fangled vector-database required.
- Follow a **fully open-source approach**, in particular prioritizing open-source integrations
  in our roadmap going forward
- Enable individuals and organizations to **circumvent vendor lock-in strategies** now ubiquitous
  in the AI and ML landscapes, by providing a clear toolset to flexibly deploy AI at the
  datastore **without necessitating subscriptions**, cloud installations, or gated-model-API functionality.

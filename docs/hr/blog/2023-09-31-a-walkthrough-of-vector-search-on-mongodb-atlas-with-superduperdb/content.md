# Walkthrough: How to enable and manage MongoDB Atlas Vector Search with SuperDuperDB

*In step-by-step tutorial we will show how to leverage MongoDB Atlas Vector Search
with SuperDuperDB, including the generation of vector embeddings. Learn how to connect embedding APIs such as OpenAI or use embedding models for example from HuggingFace with MongoDB Atlas with simple Python commands.*

:::info
SuperDuperDB makes it very easy to set up multimodal vector search with different file types (text, image, audio, video, and more).

**Install `pinnacledb` Python package**

Using vector-search with SuperDuperDB on MongoDB requires only one simple python package install:

<!--truncate-->

```bash
pip install pinnacledb
```

With this install SuperDuperDB includes all the packages needed to define a range of API based and package based 
vector-search models, such as OpenAI and Hugging-Face's `transformers`.

**Connect to your Atlas cluster using SuperDuperDB**

SuperDuperDB ships with it's own MongoDB python client, which supports
all commands supported by `pymongo`. In the example below 
the key to connecting to your Atlas cluster is the `db` object.

The `db` object contains all functionality needed to read and write to 
the MongoDB instance and also to define, save and apply a flexible range 
of AI models for vector-search.

```python
from pinnacledb.db.base.build import build_datalayer
from pinnacledb import CFG
import os

ATLAS_URI = "mongodb+srv://<user>@<atlas-server>/<database_name>"
OPENAI_API_KEY = "<your-open-ai-api-key>"

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = OPENAI_API_KEY

CFG.data_backend = ATLAS_URI
CFG.vector_search = ATLAS_URI

db = build_datalayer()
```

**Load your data**

You can download some data to play with from [this link](https://pinnacledb-public.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pymongo.json):

```bash
curl -O https://pinnacledb-public.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pymongo.json
```

The data contains all inline doc-strings of the `pymongo` Python API (official
MongoDB driver for Python). The name of the function or class is in `"res"` and
the doc-string is contained in `"value"`.

```python
import json

with open('pymongo.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
```

Here's one record to illustrate the data:

```json
{
  "key": "pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient",
  "parent": null,
  "value": "\nClient for a MongoDB instance, a replica set, or a set of mongoses.\n\n",
  "document": "mongo_client.md",
  "res": "pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient"
}
```

**Insert the data into your Atlas cluster**

We can use the SuperDuperDB connection to insert this data

```python
from pinnacledb.db.mongodb.query import Collection

collection = Collection('documents')

db.execute(
    collection.insert_many([
        Document(r) for r in data
    ])
)
```

**Define your vector model and vector-index**

Now we have data in our collection we can define the vector-index:

```python
from pinnacledb.container.vector_index import VectorIndex
from pinnacledb.container.listener import Listener
from pinnacledb.ext.numpy.array import array
from pinnacledb.ext.openai.model import OpenAIEmbedding

model = OpenAIEmbedding(model='text-embedding-ada-002')

db.add(
    VectorIndex(
        identifier=f'pymongo-docs',
        indexing_listener=Listener(
            model=model,
            key='value',
            select=Collection('documents').find(),
            predict_kwargs={'max_chunk_size': 1000},
        ),
    )
)
```

This command tells the system that we want to:

- search the `"documents"` collection
- set-up a vector-index on our Atlas cluster, using the text in the `"value"` field
- use the OpenAI model `"text-embedding-ada-002"` to create vector-embeddings

After issuing this command, SuperDuperDB does these things:

- Configures an MongoDB Atlas knn-index in the `"documents"` collection
- Saves the `model` object in the SuperDuperDB model store hosted on `gridfs`
- Applies `model` to all data in the `"documents"` collection, and saves the vectors in the documents
- Saves the fact that `model` is connected to the `"pymongo-docs"` vector-index

You can confirm that the index has been created and view the index's settings 
in the [Atlas UI](https://cloud.mongodb.com/). It should look like this:

![](atlas_screen.png)

The nesting of the index signifies the fact that the index created looks 
into the `_outputs.<key>.<model-name>` path, which is where the model's vector outputs are stored
automatically by SuperDuperDB.

**Use vector-search in a super-duper query**

Now we are ready to use the SuperDuperDB query-API for vector-search.
You'll see below, that SuperDuperDB handles all logic related to 
converting queries on the fly to vectors under the hood.

```python
from pinnacledb.db.mongodb.query import Collection
from pinnacledb.container.document import Document as D
from IPython.display import *

query = 'Find data'

result = db.execute(
    Collection('documents')
        .like(D({'value': query}), vector_index='pymongo-docs', n=5)
        .find()
)

for r in result:
    display(Markdown(f'### `{r["parent"] + "." if r["parent"] else ""}{r["res"]}`'))
    display(Markdown(r['value']))
```

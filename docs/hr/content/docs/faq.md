# FAQ
Learn more about SuperDuperDB.

<details>
<summary>Is SuperDuperDB a database?</summary>

No, SuperDuperDB is not a traditional standalone database. Instead, it is a versatile Python framework or tool designed to seamlessly integrate artificial intelligence capabilities into various databases. It supports a wide range of databases, including but not limited to MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, and more. The focus is on enhancing database functionality with AI features rather than serving as a standalone database solution.

<summary>What's the difference between SuperDuperDB and MindsDB?</summary>

The main differences between SuperDuperDB and MindsDB are outlined below:

1. **Developer Experience:**
   - **MindsDB:** Requires learning a new language created by MindsDB.
   - **SuperDuperDB:** Only requires proficiency in Python and familiar database query languages/operators.

2. **Integration with Python Ecosystem:**
   - **MindsDB:** Utilizes a cloaked connection between data sources and Python models.
   - **SuperDuperDB:** Offers full transparency in the notebook, allowing for granular output inspection, debugging, and visualization within known Python environments and tools.

3. **Vector Search:**
   - **MindsDB:** Does not support native vector embedding, resulting in no natively supported vector search capability.
   - **SuperDuperDB:** Supports vectors in any format, including raw, and integrates various vector search solutions; this includes images and videos.

4. **Support for Flexible Data Types:**
   - **MindsDB:** Limited to handling text and numbers only.
   - **SuperDuperDB:** Supports any datatype, providing flexibility in managing diverse data types.

5. **Multi-Tenant (Multi Data Store):**
   - **MindsDB:** Does not separate data source, model registry, and metadata.
   - **SuperDuperDB:** Allows different locations for data stores, models, and metadata, facilitating multi-data store setups that can share the same models.

6. **Bringing Your Own Models:**
   - **MindsDB:** Requires rewriting and reorganization of your model when bringing your own models.
   - **SuperDuperDB:** Enables the use of your framework natively without requiring any adaptation when bringing your own models.

<summary>Is plugging `pinnacledb` directly into a database secure? What precautions are in place, and can I restrict access to specific tables, such as a users table?</summary>

To adhere to the principle of least privilege, SuperDuperDB requires read-only access to the tables you intend to `index`.

One option is maintaining your database as read-only and storing the index externally, such as on your filesystem. Alternatively, you can establish a new table dedicated to housing the index (e.g pinnacle_index). In this case, the requisite step would be granting us write access to that specific table.

For enhanced security, consider creating a new user specifically for SuperDuperDB. Grant this user read-only access to your data tables and read-write access exclusively to the `pinnacle_index` table.

If you value privacy as well, we recommend engaging in a more in-depth discussion within the project's Slack channel: [SuperDuperDB Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/pinnacledb/shared_invite/zt-1zuojj0k0-RjAYBs1TDsvEa7yaFGa6QA).

<summary> What benefits does pinnacledb offer for training AI models (such as Classification) compared to conventional methods? Are there any fundamental distinctions? </summary>

While the underlying algorithm for training remains unchanged, the key distinction lies in the enhanced connectivity between your model and the data stores. 

This improved connectivity enables users to easily customize their models for different data subsets, offering flexibility in model development.

Likewise, SuperDuperDB offers numerous conveniences for streaming inference, including Change-Data-Capture support, enabling the fast release of real-time applications.

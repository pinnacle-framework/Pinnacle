# MongoDB select queries

SuperDuperDB supports the `pymongo` query API to build select queries.
There is one slight difference however, since queries built with `pymongo`'s formalism
are executed lazily:

Whereas in `pymongo` one might write:

```python
client.my_db.my_collection.find_one()
```

with `pinnacledb` one would write:

```python
from pinnacledb.backends.mongodb import Collection

my_collection = Collection('my_collection')

result = db.execute(my_collection.find_one())
```

# Data integrations

SuperDuperDB integrates with 3 types of data-backend:

- NoSQL
    - MongoDB Community Edition
    - MongoDB Atlas
- SQL
    - MySQL
    - PostgreSQL
    - Oracle
    - SQLite
    - Snowflake
    - DuckDB
    - Clickhouse
- In-memory tabular formats
    - Pandas

Although these data-backends provide very different functionality, 
with SuperDuperDB they are accessible via a uniform API.

However, developers should bear in mind that there are a few 
differences between MongoDB and SQL data-backends.

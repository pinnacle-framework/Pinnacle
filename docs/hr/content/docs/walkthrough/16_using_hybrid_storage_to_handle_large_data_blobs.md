# Working with and inserting large pieces of data

Some applications require large data-blobs and objects, which are larger than the objects which are supported by the underlying database.

For example:

- MongoDB supports documents up to `16MB`
- SQLite `BINARY` has a default limit of `1GB`

In addition, for some applications, which are very read-heavy (for example training CNN on a database of images), storing data directly in the database, can lead to impaired database performance.

In such cases, `pinnacledb` supports hybrid storage, where large data blobs, are stored on the local filesystem.

`pinnacledb` supports this hybrid storage, via `env` variable or configuration:

```python
CFG.downloads.hybrid = True
```

...or


```bash
export pinnacleDB_DOWNLOADS_HYBRID=true
```

Once this has been configured, inserting data proceeds exactly as before, with the difference 
that items inserted via URI, are saved on the local filesystem, and referred to in the database.

# How-To Guide

## Start here

This how-to walkthrough is designed to take you through `pinnacledb` usage step-by-step.
To build more understanding of `pinnacledb` read the ["Fundmentals" section](../fundamentals/glossary.md).

The documents in this section build on one-another, and all assume that you have configured and connected to `pinnacledb`.

If you haven't done this yet, then read the [getting-started](../get_started) and [setup](../setup) sections first.

Once you've done that you'll have learned how to instantiate the variable [`db`](../setup/connecting.md), which is an instance of
the [`Datalayer`](../fundamentals/datalayer_overview.md) based on your [configuration](../setup/configuration.md).

You'll probably also want to ready about the query API which is relevant to your database:

- [MongoDB Query API](../data_integrations/mongodb.md)
- [Ibis Query API for SQL](../data_integrations/sql.md)

# Daemonizing `.predict` with listeners

In many AI applications, it's important that a catalogue of predictions is maintained for 
all data in the database, or even all changed data.

In order to allow developers to implement this functionality, `pinnacledb` offers
the `Listener` abstraction:

## Creating listeners in-line with `.predict`

### Procedural API

To create a `Listener`, when applying a `Predictor` instance to `db`, the following 
procedural pattern applies:

```python
my_model.predict(
    X='<input-field>',
    db=db,
    select=query,
    listen=True,
)
```

### Declarative API

This is equivalent to:

```python
db.add(
    Listener(
        model=my_model,
        key='my-key',
        select=<query>,
        predict_kwargs={**<model_dot_predict_kwargs>},
    )
)
```

## Explanation

If a `Listener` has been created, whenever new data is added to `db`, 
the `Predictor` instance is loaded and predictions are evaluated on the inserted data.

If change-data-capture has been activated, this process applies, even if the data is inserted
from a client other than `pinnacledb`.
